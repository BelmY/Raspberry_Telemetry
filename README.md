I will be using a External GPS and temprature giomerty meater to generate the Telemetry Data.
The System will use GPDS and direwolf with Beacon confiferation to send System data.
The Diarewolf RX will be a RTL dongle withe a nis sharp Saw or Crystal filter as a frontend.
The transmitter and resver can be configerd to be FM repeater as well.
