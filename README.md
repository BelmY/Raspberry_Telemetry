# Raspberry_Telemetry
This code is not jet compleet but work in progress.(project just started 14Sep/2017)
This project will have the files for a Cube Sat Telemetry system Using Raspberry Pi Transmitter Board.

I will be using a External GPS and temprature giomerty meater to generate the Telemetry Data.
The System will use GPDS and direwolf with Beacon confiferation to send System data.
The Diarewolf RX will be a RTL dongle withe a nis sharp Saw or Crystal filter as a frontend.
The transmitter and resver can be configerd to be FM repeater as well.
